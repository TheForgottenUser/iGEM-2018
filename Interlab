        <h1>Interlab</h1>
        <p>
            We went to University of Washington Tacoma to use the 
            FilterMax F5 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader. So we would like to say
            thank you to Dr. Finke for letting us to use his equipment!
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            The purpose of this yearâ€™s interlab protocol was to take the absorbance of the 
            bacterial stain E. Coli (created by transforming the plasmid) and standardize the 
            fluorescence rate for future use at iGEM. 
            Our next week of interlab lab work was split into two days: calibration day and 
            cell measurement protocol day. The team quickly learned the importance of accurate 
            pipetting as we had our first experiences with the plate reader.

            We followed all the protocols provided by iGem, so click

                here</a>to see the methods and materials we used. </p>

        <p>
            After overnight incubation, we put out the samples and counted the one that had less
            than 300 colonies. After counting the samples, we multiplied with the dilution factor
            given in interlab to calculate CFU/mL. We had 6 samples each for positive and negative
            controls, and it was categorized by dilution 3, 4, and 5, and each sample had a different
            dilution factor according to the protocol. We noticed that there were a samples , so some of
            the data had to be left blank. CFU stands for colony forming unit, so the number recorded as 
            CFU/mL shows the number of colonies present for every 1 mL of sample (similar as concept of 
            molarity). And the concentration of bacteria is directly related to the fluorescence. 
            If there is more concentration, it will fluorescence more. The measuring of absorbance also 
            helped us to see the concentration, since high concentration of bacteria will scatter the 
            light more than the diluted samples, resulting in the high absorbance value.

                we analyzed the relationship between absorbance and particle count.
                We found out that high absorbance means more scattering due to the 
                high concentration of bacteria, and they have linear relationship</p></div>

                absorance and the particle count, and we found that slight change in absorbance 
                will change the particle count exponentially</p></div>

                of fluorscence during the cailibration process, we found that there is a direct
                relationship between fluorescein concentration and fluorscence</p></div>
        <div><img src="chart (4).png" width="250" height="250"><p>On this standard
                curve, we noticed that there is a minimum amount of fluorescein
                needed to express fluorescence. The non zero y intercept shows that example.</p></div>
